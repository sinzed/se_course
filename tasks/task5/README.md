Design the Software Solution Using High-Level and Low-Level Design Techniques

## Description
In this task, your team will design the software solution using high-level and low-level design techniques. By doing this, youâ€™ll create a clear and detailed blueprint of how the software should be structured, implemented, and tested.

## Steps
1- Review the Requirements Specification Review the requirements specification that you created in the previous task. Ensure everyone understands the user stories, use cases, and prototypes.
2- Define Design Goals and Principles Define the design goals and principles that are relevant for your software solution, such as modularity, cohesion, coupling, abstraction, etc. Use techniques like design patterns, design heuristics, or design guidelines to guide your design decisions.
3- Create High-Level Design Using Architecture and UML Create high-level design using architecture and UML. 5- Use techniques like architectural styles, architectural views, or architectural patterns to define the overall structure and behavior of the software solution. Use techniques like UML diagrams, UML notation, or UML tools to model the components, relationships, and interactions of the software solution.
4- Create Low-Level Design Using OO Design and Database Design Create low-level design using OO design and database design. Use techniques like OO principles, OO analysis, or OO design patterns to define the classes, attributes, methods, and associations of the software solution. Use techniques like database models, database schemas, or database normalization to define the tables, columns, keys, and constraints of the software solution.
5- Create Security Design Using Security Design Techniques Create security design using security design techniques. Use techniques like security requirements, security threats, or security controls to define the security aspects of the software solution. Use techniques like encryption, authentication, authorization, or auditing to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the software solution.
6- Document the Design Specification Using Reports and Training Document the design specification using reports and training. Use tools like Word, PowerPoint, or a simple document to organize and present the design specification. Use techniques like report writing, report structure, or report presentation to communicate the design rationale, design choices, and design trade-offs of the software solution. Use techniques like training materials, training methods, or training evaluation to educate the stakeholders (users, clients, etc.) about the design features, design benefits, and design limitations of the software solution.
7- Validate and Verify the Design: Validate and verify the design with the stakeholders (users, clients, etc.) to ensure they are correct, complete, consistent, and feasible. Use techniques like reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, or testing to check the quality and accuracy of the design specification.
8- Manage Changing Design: Manage changing design throughout the project lifecycle using the selected process model. Use techniques like change control, traceability, or configuration management to handle changes in the design specification.

## Deliverable:
A detailed design specification document using architecture, UML, OO design, database design, and security design, created using the selected process model. This document will serve as a blueprint for the developers and the testers, ensuring that the software solution is structured, implemented, and tested according to the design goals and principles.
