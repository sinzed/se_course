Gather and Refine Requirements Using User Stories and Use Cases
## Description
In this task, your team will gather and refine the requirements for your software solution using user stories and use cases. By doing this, you’ll create a clear and detailed specification of what the software should do and how it should interact with the users and the environment.

## Steps
1. Review the Project Idea and Goals
Review the project idea and its goals that you defined in the previous task. Ensure everyone understands the problem statement and the desired outcome. 

2. Define Requirements Categories
Define the categories of requirements that are relevant for your software solution, such as functional, non-functional, user, system, etc. Use techniques like MoSCoW or FURPS to prioritize and classify requirements. 

3. Gather Requirements Using User Stories
Gather requirements from the perspective of the end-users using user stories. Use techniques like interviews, surveys, observations, or brainstorming to elicit user needs and expectations. Write user stories using the format “As a <role>, I want <goal>, so that <benefit>”. 

4. Refine Requirements Using Use Cases:
Refine requirements from the perspective of the system using use cases. Use techniques like scenarios, diagrams, or templates to describe the interactions between the system and the actors (users or other systems). Write use cases using the format “Use Case: <name>, Actor: <actor>, Precondition: <precondition>, Main Flow: <steps>, Postcondition: <postcondition>, Alternative Flows: <alternatives>”. 

5. Create Prototypes
Create prototypes of the software solution to demonstrate the key functionalities and features. Use techniques like sketches, wireframes, mockups, or prototypes to create low-fidelity or high-fidelity prototypes. 

6. Document the Requirements Specification
Document the requirements specification using user stories, use cases, and prototypes. Use tools like Word, Excel, or a simple document to organize and present the requirements specification. 

7. Validate and Verify the Requirements:
Validate and verify the requirements with the stakeholders (users, clients, etc.) to ensure they are correct, complete, consistent, and feasible. Use techniques like reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, or testing to check the quality and accuracy of the requirements specification.

8. Manage Changing Requirements:
Manage changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle using the selected process model. Use techniques like change control, traceability, or configuration management to handle changes in the requirements specification.

## Deliverable:
A detailed requirements specification document using user stories, use cases, and prototypes, created using the selected process model. This document will serve as a contract between the developers and the stakeholders, ensuring that the software solution meets the user needs and expectations.
